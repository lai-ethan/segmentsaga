# This is useful for setting up the database schema before running the application
# It ensures that all necessary tables are created in the database
# You can run this script using the command: python create_tables.py
# Make sure to have the database connection details set up in your environment variables or .env file
# This script is typically run once to set up the database schema
# after that, you can run your FastAPI application which will use these tables
